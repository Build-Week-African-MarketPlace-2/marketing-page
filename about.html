            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>
                Our mission is to empower cross-border traders to exercise their rights as citizens of the EAC – able to trade legally, safely and profitably across borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Informal cross-border trade is a major feature of African economies: it creates jobs, contributes to food and energy security, and alleviates poverty. However many traders are unaware of their rights, required customs procedures and documentation, making them vulnerable to corruption and harassment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access to information is critical for cross-border traders to identify trade opportunities, comply with trade regulations, and negotiate favourable prices in foreign markets. SAUM’s trade and market information platform directly targets the barriers to information to enhance small-scale competitiveness and profitability in East Africa

            <h3>Key Figures</h3>
           <ul>
                <li>68% of traders have been able to identify new products to trade in and 90% have identified new markets.</li>
                <li>Baseline data indicates that prior to using SAUM traders were spending 3.50-13USD on calls to other traders/brokers to access trade and market information and 50min-5hours travelling to markets in order to access market information. By using SAUM, cross-border traders are spending as much as $0.50USD per week in network access fees to access trade and market information and no longer need to travel to markets to verify market information.</li>
                <li>76% of surveyed users said that since using SAUM they are aware of the requirements for clearing their goods through the gazetted border, while 57% are aware of the taxes applicable to their consignments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                “With SAUM now, at the comfort of my couch or kitchen, I can get all the business and customs information I need right in my cheap old phone. I’m now more confident to pass through the gazetted route and not scared of personally clearing my goods.”
